## Roles

A kind has 1 of 4 roles.

- `hierarchy`: the node sits in the tree. `parents` lists groups of parent fields. The first group that names a node places the node in the tree. Every group counts for the scope.
- `part`: the node comes from a part field of its owner.
- `linked`: the node links to the hierarchy and has its own tree group. A scope pulls it in when a node of the scope links to it.
- `check`: the node comes from a check field.

A kind can set `placedUnder`. A node of that kind that reaches no node of the named kind goes to a warning group in the tree.

## Kind keys in the profile

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kinds` | The node kinds: id, label, plural, role, colour for the light and the dark theme, parent field groups, a citation rule (with an optional `name` path for the display name of the source) and the chips of a summary. |
| `parts` | Which kinds own parts, in which field, and the fields of a part. |
| `embedded` | Objects in a node that are nodes of their own: the owner kind, the dotted path of the object, the new kind, the key of the id in the object (needed only for an object) and the edge. The edge is a parent field of the owner. It differs from the field. |
| `checks` | The check field, the check kind, the check types and their identity. |
